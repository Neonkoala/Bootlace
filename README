Bootlace
by Nick Dawson (Neonkoala)

V1.1

Credits: planetbeing, poorlad, marky and apocolipse.

WARNING: You're on the *testing* branch! This means it doesn't work, or at least not in a way you expect it to.

Testing status: I may update this peridoically. Currently GUI is functional, nothing else is. iDroid install function is current focus for development.

Requirements

This app requires a SPECIFIC version of oepniboot to be installed to allow configuration and quickbooting. I am maintaining a compatible version here on github until changes are merged.

Other requirements:
* iOS 3.0 -> 3.1.3
* An internet connection for iDroid install/upgrade features
* iPhone 2G or 3G
* Bravery - my code is hardly the best :P
