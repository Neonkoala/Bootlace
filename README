Bootlace
by Nick Dawson (Neonkoala)

V2.0

Credits: planetbeing, poorlad, marky and apocolipse.

WARNING: You're on the *testing* branch! This means it doesn't work, or at least not in a way you expect it to.

Testing status: I may update this peridoically. Currently everything is working but install craps out for some users at the dumping multitouch stage.

Requirements

This app requires a SPECIFIC version of oepniboot to be installed to allow configuration and quickbooting. I am maintaining a compatible version here on github until changes are merged.

Other requirements:
* iOS 4.0 -> 4.0.1
* An internet connection for iDroid install/upgrade features
* iPhone 3G
* Bravery - my code is hardly the best :P
